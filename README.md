# "TODO" REST API

RESTful API for a TODO application.

## System Design

This applications is meant to be used in a microservices architecture. ItÂ´s stateless so it can scale out just adding more application in parallel and load balancing the requests.

It uses a datastore, in this case a MariaDB database, so the data can  persist.

User management is out of the scope of this project, this implies deal with password management and meet security requirements and there are different projects much more mature that can provide it.

TODO app assumes that there is a user table in the database and use the authentication headers to link the TODO lists to the authenticated user.

## Features

* User management is out of the scope of this project, this implies deal with password management and meet security requirements and there are different approaches with a much mature

* Tag filtering

## Testing

1. Deploy a database

docker run -d -rm -p 3306:3306 --name todo-db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d mariadb:10.3

2. Create the database schema

docker exec -i todo-db mysql -uroot -ppassword < create_db.sql
